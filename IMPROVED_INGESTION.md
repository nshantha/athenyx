# Improved Ingestion System

The ingestion system has been enhanced to be more generic and robust, and now properly handles the ontology structure with proper relationships between all components.

## Key Improvements

1. **Generic Repository Support**:
   - Removed hardcoded repository values from the code
   - System now handles any Git repository URL
   - Updated path construction in the Neo4j loader to properly handle repository paths

2. **Unified Ingestion Process**:
   - Created a unified ingestion script (`run_ingestion.py`) that combines all steps
   - Optional clearing of existing repository data
   - Main ingestion process
   - Relationship fixing between nodes
   - Ontology structure repair
   - Added `--force-reindex` option to reindex repositories even if commit hash hasn't changed

3. **Proper Ontology Structure**:
   - Fixed the hierarchical knowledge graph structure:
     ```
     Repository
       ├── File
       │    ├── Function
       │    │    └── CodeChunk (with embeddings)
       │    ├── Class
       │    │    └── CodeChunk (with embeddings)
       │    └── CodeChunk (with embeddings)
       │
       ├── Service
       │    ├── ApiEndpoint
       │    │    └── Parameters/ReturnTypes
       │    ├── DataModel
       │    └── ServiceInterface
     ```
   - Created proper connections between Classes and Functions to their parent Files
   - Connected CodeChunks to their parent Classes and Functions
   - Reduced orphaned CodeChunks with better relationship detection

4. **Improved Protobuf File Handling**:
   - Implemented intelligent path normalization for proto files
   - Properly handles duplicate proto files located in different paths
   - Connects protobuf definitions (messages/services) to all relevant file locations
   - Ensures proper parent-child connections for proto chunks
   - Minimizes direct repository fallback relationships
   - Adds pre-emptive file node creation to avoid orphaned chunks

5. **Improved Neo4j Integration**:
   - Added support for reading credentials from a .env file
   - Created a `setup_credentials.py` script to manage Neo4j credentials
   - Added a `--test-connection` option to verify Neo4j connectivity

6. **Diagnostic and Verification Tools**:
   - Created `check_nodes.py` to verify node counts and types
   - Created `fix_ontology.py` for verifying and fixing the ontology structure
   - Created visualization tools to inspect the hierarchy (`query_hierarchy.py` and `query_java_file.py`)
   - Added `check_fallback_relationships.py` to detect and report on improper connections

## Usage

### Basic Ingestion

To ingest a repository using the improved system:

```bash
python run_ingestion.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Full Ingestion with Options

To run a complete ingestion process with all options:

```bash
python run_ingestion.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git --description "Repository description" --clear --force-reindex
```

### Ontology Verification

To verify the ontology structure:

```bash
python helpers/fix_ontology.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git --verify-only
```

### Checking Fallback Relationships

To check for fallback relationships that bypass proper hierarchy:

```bash
python helpers/check_fallback_relationships.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git --save
```

### Visualizing the Hierarchy

To view the repository hierarchy:

```bash
python helpers/query_hierarchy.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

To examine Java files with their classes and functions:

```bash
python helpers/query_java_file.py --repo-url https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

## Ontology Verification Results

After running the ingestion process, you can check the connections between different nodes in the graph. A properly ingested repository should show:

1. 100% of Files connected to the Repository
2. 100% of Functions connected to their parent Files
3. 100% of Classes connected to their parent Files
4. All CodeChunks properly connected to either Functions, Classes, or directly to Files
5. Minimal or no orphaned CodeChunks
6. Minimal or no direct Repository to CodeChunk fallback relationships

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, refer to:

- `ingestion/config.py` - General ingestion settings
- `app/core/config.py` - Application configuration settings
- `.env` file - Environment-specific settings (Neo4j credentials, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the ingestion process:

1. Use `helpers/check_nodes.py` to examine the nodes in the database
2. Run `helpers/fix_ontology.py` to fix any broken connections
3. Check Neo4j connectivity with `python run_ingestion.py --test-connection`
4. Check for fallback relationships with `python helpers/check_fallback_relationships.py`
5. Clear the database with `python helpers/clean_db.py` if you need to start fresh
